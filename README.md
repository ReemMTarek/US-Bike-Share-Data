# US-Bike-Share-Data:
In this project,I made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States.
I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. Also I have created visualization to enhace the ouput

## Language:
Python and some of it libraries.

## HTML file:
In case you are not familiar with jupyter notebooks, feel free to read the HTML file, as it has all the steps and the ouput consolidated.
